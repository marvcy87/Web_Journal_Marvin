      <strong>What is IOT?</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with
        sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose
        of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.

      <strong>History of IOT</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        -The idea of embedding sensors and intelligence into physical items was initially proposed in the 1980s when
        some college students decided to alter a Coca-Cola vending machine to allow for remote monitoring of its
        contents. But technological advancement was slow and cumbersome.
      </p>
      <p>
        -Computer scientist Kevin Ashton first used the term "Internet of Things" in 1999. Ashton advocated putting radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips on products to follow them through a supply chain while he was employed by Procter & Gamble.
      </p>

        <p>
          In 2000, LG announced the first smart refrigerator, in 2007 the first iPhone was launched and by 2008, the number of connected devices exceeded the number of people on the planet.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2009, Google started testing driverless cars and in 2011, Google’s Nest smart thermostat hit the market, which allowed remote control of central heating.

                      <li>1.<strong> Security:</strong> Security is one of the major challenges of IoT. As the number of connected devices increases, the potential for malicious actors to gain access to sensitive data or systems also increases.</li>
                      <li>2. <strong>Data Management:</strong> IoT devices generate large amounts of data that needs to be stored, managed, and analyzed.</li>
                      <li>3. <strong>Interoperability:</strong> IoT devices must be able to communicate with each other and with other systems.</li>
                      <li>4. <strong>Privacy:</strong> IoT devices can collect sensitive data about users, which raises privacy concerns.</li>
                      <li>5. <strong>Cost:</strong> IoT devices and systems can be expensive to implement and maintain.
                      </li>
                      <li>6. <strong>Scalability:</strong> IoT systems must be able to scale to accommodate the increasing number of connected devices.</li>

            <br>
                  <p>
                    The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of real-world items that have sensors, software, and other technologies built into them so they can gather and share data. 
                    These products might range from common household goods to sophisticated machinery. 
                    An IoT platform receives the data once it has been collected, stores it, and processes it to produce insights and prompt actions.

                          The IoT devices include wireless sensors, software, actuators, computer devices and more. They are attached to a particular object that operates through the internet, enabling the transfer of data among objects or people automatically without human intervention.

                            <p>
                              IoT devices share the sensor data they collect by connecting to an IoT gateway or other edge device where data is either sent to the cloud to be analyzed or analyzed locally. Sometimes, these devices communicate with other related devices and act on the information they get from one another

                          The home can be called smart when it has a range of smart devices that you can control remotely by setting them the way you like to automatize house maintenance. They can also be united into one network. For example, the lights can turn on at the moment you enter the home (lamps will know it from the sensors) or your vacuum cleaner can start cleaning every day at 11 AM.

                        <p>
                          Smart cities use IoT devices such as connected sensors, lights, and meters to collect and analyze data. The cities then use this data to improve infrastructure, public utilities and services, and more.
                          Smart city devices work to make everyday tasks easier and more efficient, while relieving pain points related to public safety, traffic, and environmental issues.

                          The usage of IoT technology in the farming sector in mitigating the challenges like weather issues, farm management, pesticide requirements, crop quality, etc. It thereby provides a step forward to grow production in terms of best quality and revenue.

                          based on Internet of Things technologies, is envisioned to enable producers and farmers to reduce waste and improve productivity by optimizing the usage of fertilizers to boost the efficiency of plants. It gives better control to the farmers for their livestock, growing crops, cutting costs, and resources.
