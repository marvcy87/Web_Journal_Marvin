        <strong>What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
              <p>Artificial Intelligence is composed of two words Artificial and Intelligence.
                Artificial defines "man-made," and intelligence defines "thinking power", or “the ability to learn
                and solve problems” hence Artificial Intelligence means "a man-made thinking power."</p>
              <p>So, we can define Artificial Intelligence (AI) as the branch of computer science by which we can
                create intelligent machines which can behave like a human, think like humans, and able to make decisions.</p>
              <p>Intelligence, as we know, is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge. Knowledge is the
                information acquired through experience. Experience is the knowledge gained through exposure (training).
                Summing the terms up, we get artificial intelligence as the “copy of something natural (i.e., human
                beings)‘WHO’ is capable of acquiring and applying the information it has gained
                through exposure.”</p>
              <p>Artificial Intelligence exists when a machine can have human-based skills such as learning,
                reasoning, and solving problems with Artificial Intelligence you do not need to preprogram a machine to
                do some work, despite that you can create a machine with programmed algorithms which can work with
                own intelligence.</p>

                <p>Intelligence is composed of:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>➢ Reasoning</li>
                  <li>➢ Learning</li>
                  <li>➢ Problem Solving</li>
                  <li>➢ Perception</li>
                  <li>➢ Linguistic Intelligence</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                  <p>
                    An AI system is composed of an agent and its environment. An agent (e.g., human or robot) is
                    anything that can perceive its environment through sensors and acts upon that environment through
                    effectors. Intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them. In classical planning problems, the
                    agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world, allowing the agent to be certain of the
                    consequences of its actions. However, if the agent is not the only actor, then it requires that the agent can
                    reason under uncertainty. This calls for an agent that cannot only assess its environment and make
                    predictions but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment. Machine perception is the
                    ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, sensors, etc.) to deduce aspects of the
                    world. e.g., Computer Vision.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    High-profile examples of AI include autonomous vehicles (such as drones and self-driving cars),
                    medical diagnosis, creating art (such as poetry), proving mathematical theorems, playing games (such as
                    Chess or Go), search engines (such as Google search), online assistants (such as Siri), image recognition in
                    photographs, spam filtering, prediction of judicial decisions and targeting online advertisements
                    AI deals with the area of developing computing systems that are capable of performing tasks that
                    humans are very good at, for example recognizing objects, recognizing and making sense of
                    speech, and decision making in a constrained environment.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The advent of Big Data, driven by the arrival of the internet, smart mobile and social media has
                    enabled AI algorithms, in particular from Machine Learning and Deep Learning, to leverage Big Data and
                    perform their tasks more optimally. This combined with cheaper and more powerful hardware such as
                    Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) has enabled AI to evolve into more complex architectures. Machine
                    Learning is an advanced form of AI where the machine can learn as it goes rather than having every action
                    programmed by humans.

                Many times, students get confused between Machine
                Learning and Artificial Intelligence (see figure 3.1), but
                Machine learning, a fundamental concept of AI research since
                the field’s inception, is the study of computer algorithms that
                improve automatically through experience. The term
                machine learning was introduced by Arthur Samuel in 1959.
                Neural networks are biologically inspired networks that
                extract features from the data in a hierarchical fashion. The
                field of neural networks with several hidden layers is called
                deep learning.

        <strong>What Comprises to Artificial Intelligence?</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
            <p>
              Artificial Intelligence is not just a part of computer science even it's so vast and requires lots of
              other factors that can contribute to it. To create the AI-first we should know that how intelligence is
              composed, so Intelligence is an intangible part of our brain which is a combination of Reasoning, learning,
              problem-solving, perception, language understanding, etc.

            <br>
            <br>
                <p>Following are some main advantages of Artificial Intelligence:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong><em>➢ High Accuracy with fewer errors:</em></strong> AI machines or systems are prone to fewer errors and high
                          accuracy as it takes decisions as per pre-experience or information.</li>
                        <li><strong><em>➢ High-Speed:</em></strong> AI systems can be of very high-speed and fast-decision making, because of that
                          AI systems can beat a chess champion in the Chess game.</li>
                        <li><strong><em>➢ High reliability:</em></strong> AI machines are highly reliable and can perform the same action multiple times
                          with high accuracy.</li>
                        <li><strong><em>➢ Useful for risky areas:</em></strong> AI machines can be helpful in situations such as defusing a bomb,
                          exploring the ocean floor, where to employ a human can be risky.</li>
                        <li><strong><em>➢ Digital Assistant:</em></strong> AI can be very useful to provide digital assistant to users such as AI
                          technology is currently used by various E-commerce websites to show the products as per customer
                          requirements.</li>
                        <li><strong><em>➢ Useful as a public utility:</em></strong> AI can be very useful for public utilities such as a self-driving car
                          which can make our journey safer and hassle-free, facial recognition for security purposes, Natural language
                          processing (for search engines, for spelling checker, for assistant like Siri, for translation like google
                          translate), etc.</li>
                    </ul>

        <strong><u>DISADVANTAGES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</u></strong>
              <br>
              <br>
                    <p>
                        One of the key features that distinguishes us, humans, from everything else in the world is
                        intelligence. This ability to understand, apply knowledge and improve skills has played a significant role
                        in our evolution and establishing human civilization. But many people (including Elon Musk the founder
                        of ....) believe that the advancement in technology can create a superintelligence that can threaten human
                        existence.
                    </p>
                      <p>
                        Every technology has some disadvantages, and the same goes for Artificial intelligence. Being so
                        advantageous technology still, it has some disadvantages which we need to keep in our mind while creating
                        an AI system. Following are the disadvantages of AI:
                      </p>
                          <ul>
                                <li><strong><em>➢ High Cost:</em></strong> The hardware and software requirement of AI is very costly as it requires lots of
                                  maintenance to meet current world requirements.</li>
                                <li><strong><em>➢ Can't think out of the box:</em></strong> Even we are making smarter machines with AI, but still they cannot
                                  work out of the box, as the robot will only do that work for which they are trained, or programmed.</li>
                                <li><strong><em>No feelings and emotions:</em></strong> AI machines can be an outstanding performer, but still it does not
                                  have the feeling so it cannot make any kind of emotional attachment with humans, and may sometime be
                                  harmful for users if the proper care is not taken.</li>
                                <li><strong><em>➢ Increase dependence on machines:</em></strong> With the increment of technology, people are getting more
                                  dependent on devices and hence they are losing their mental capabilities.</li>
                                <li><strong><em>➢ No Original Creativity:</em></strong> As humans are so creative and can imagine some new ideas but still AI
                                  machines cannot beat this power of human intelligence and cannot be creative and imaginative.</li>

                      Artificial Intelligence is not a new word and not a new technology for researchers. This technology
                      is much older than you would imagine. Even there are the myths of Mechanical men in Ancient Greek and
                      Egyptian Myths. The following are some milestones in the history of AI which define the journey from the
                      AI generation to till date development.

                                ➢ Artificial Intelligence has a remarkable role in Robotics. Usually, general robots are
                                programmed such that they can perform some repetitive task, but with the help of AI, we can create
                                intelligent robots which can perform tasks with their own experiences without pre-programmed.

                                      <li>➢ Facebook - When you upload photos to Facebook, the service automatically highlights faces
                                        and suggests friends tag.</li>
                                      <li>➢ Pinterest - Pinterest uses computer vision, an application of AI where computers are taught to
                                        “see,” in order to automatically identify objects in images (or “pins”) and then recommend visually similar
                                        pins. Other applications of machine learning at Pinterest includes spam prevention, search, and discovery,
                                        ad performance and monetization, and email marketing.</li>
                                      <li>➢ Instagram - Instagram, which Facebook acquired in 2012, uses machine learning to identify the
                                        contextual meaning of emoji, which have been steadily replacing slang (for instance, a laughing emoji could
                                        replace “lol”)</li>
                                      <li>➢ Snapchat - Snapchat introduced facial filters, called Lenses, in 2015. These filters track facial
                                        movements, allowing users to add animated effects or digital masks that adjust when their faces moved.
                                        IV. Online Shopping</li>
                                      <li>➢ Search - Your Amazon searches (“ironing board”, “pizza stone”, “Android charger”, etc.)
                                        quickly return a list of the most relevant products related to your search</li>
                                      <li>➢ Recommendations - You see recommendations for products you’re interested in as “customers
                                        who viewed this item also viewed” and “customers who bought this item also bought”, as well as via
                                        personalized recommendations on the home page, bottom of item pages, and through email. Amazon uses
                                        artificial neural networks to generate these product recommendations.</li>
                            </ul>

        <strong>V. Mobile Use</strong>
                <p>
                  <strong><u>➢ Voice-to-Text</u></strong> - A standard feature on smartphones today is voice-to-text. By pressing a button
                  or saying a particular phrase (“Ok Google”, for example), you can start speaking and your phone converts
                  the audio into text
                </p>
                <p>
                      <strong><u>➢ Smart Personal Assistants</u></strong> - Now that voice-to-text technology is accurate enough to rely on
                      for basic conversation, it has become the control interface for a newgeneration of smart personal assistants
                </p>
                    <ul>
                          <li><strong><em>o Siri and Google Now</em></strong> (now succeeded by the more sophisticated Google Assistant), which could
                            perform internet searches, set reminders, and integrate with your calendar.</li>
                          <li><strong><em>o Amazon</em></strong> expanded upon this model with the announcement of complementary hardware and
                            software components:</li>
                          <li><strong><em>o Alexa,</em></strong> an AI-powered personal assistant that accepts voice commands to create to-do lists, order
                            items online, set reminders, and answer questions (via internet searches)</li>
                          <li><strong><em>o Echo</em></strong> (and later, Dot) smart speakers that allow you to integrate Alexa into your living room and
                            use voice commands to ask natural language questions, play music, order pizza, hail an Uber, and integrate
                            with smart home devices.</li>
                          
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                          ➢ Microsoft has followed suit with Cortana, its own AI assistant that comes pre-loaded on
                          Windows computers and Microsoft smartphones.
