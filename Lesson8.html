                                    <em>Cloud computing</em> is on-demand access, via the internet, to computing resources—applications, servers (physical servers and virtual servers),  data storage, development tools, networking capabilities, and more—hosted at a remote data center managed by a cloud services provider (or CSP). The CSP makes these resources available for a monthly subscription fee or bills them according to usage.

        <strong>How do Quantum Computers Work?</strong>
              <br>
              <br>
                    <ul>
                          <li><em>Superfluids</em>: 	Quantum processors need to be very cold about a hundredth of a degree above absolute zero. To achieve this, we use super-cooled superfluids to create superconductors.
                          </li>
                          <li><em>Superconductors</em>: 	At those ultra-low temperatures, certain materials in processors exhibit another important quantum mechanical effect: electrons move through them without resistance. This makes them "superconductors."
                          </li>
                          <li><em>Control</em>: 	 Quantum computers use Josephson junctions as superconducting qubits. By firing microwave photons at these qubits, we can control their behavior and get them to hold, change, and read out individual units of quantum information.
                          </li>
                          <li><em>Superposition</em>: 	A qubit itself isn't very useful. But it can perform an important trick: placing the quantum information it holds into a state of superposition, which represents a combination of all possible configurations of the qubit. Groups of qubits in superposition can create complex, multidimensional computational spaces. Complex problems can be represented in new ways in these spaces.

                          </li>
                          <li><em>Entanglement</em>: is a quantum mechanical effect that correlates the behavior of two separate things. When two qubits are entangled, changes to one qubit directly impact the other. Quantum algorithms leverage those relationships to find solutions to complex problems.

        <strong>7 Common Computer Vision Tasks </strong>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                        <ul>
                          <li><em>1. Image classification </em> deals with processing the entire image as a whole and assigning a specific label to it. Given a group of images, the task is to classify them into a set of predefined classes using solely a set of sample images that have already been classied.
                          </li>
                          <li><em>2. Object detection</em> looks for class-specific details in an image or a video and identifies them whenever they appear. These classes can be cars, animals, humans, or anything on which the detection model has been trained. Object detection, as the name suggests, refers to detection and localization of objects using bounding boxes.</li>
                          <li><em>3.  Image Segmentation</em> is the division of an image into subparts or sub-objects to demonstrate that the machine can discern an object from the background and/or another object in the same image.</li>
                          <li><em>4. Face and person recognition </em> is a subpart of object detection where the primary object being detected is the human face. Facial recognition systems search for common features and landmarks like eyes, lips, or a nose, and classify a face using these features and the positioning of these landmarks.</li>
                          <li><em>5. Edge detection</em> is the task of detecting boundaries in objects. It is algorithmically performed with the help of mathematical methods that help detect sharp changes or discontinuities in the brightness of the image.</li>
                          <li><em>6. Image Restoration </em> refers to the restoration or the reconstruction of faded and old image hard copies that have been captured and stored in an improper manner, leading to loss of quality of the image.</li>
                          <li><em>Feature matching </em> in computer vision are regions of an image that tell us the most about a particular object in the image. While edges are strong indicators of object detail and therefore important features, much more localized and sharp details—like corners, also serve as features. Feature matching helps us to relate the features of similar region of one image with those of another image.</li>
