                      <br>
                            <p>
                              While the term data science is not new, the meanings and connotations have changed over time. The word first appeared in the ’60s as an alternative name for statistics. In the late ’90s, computer science professionals formalized the term. A proposed definition for data science saw it as a separate field with three aspects: data design, collection, and analysis. It still took another decade for the term to be used outside of academia.

                          <p> <em>Data Science</em> is a          multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.

                                  <li><em>- Data Curation :</em> is the active management of data over its life cycle to ensure it meets the necessary data quality requirements for its effective usage.

                                  <li><em>- Data Storage :</em> is the persistence and management of data in a scalable way that satisfies the needs of applications that require fast access to the data.

        <strong>What is Cluster Computing?</strong>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                        <p>
                          Cluster computing refers that many of the computers connected on a network and they perform like a single entity. Each computer that is connected to the network is called a node. Cluster computing offers solutions to solve complicated problems by providing faster computational speed, and enhanced data integrity.

                        </p>

          <strong>Whatt is Hadoop?</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                          <p>
                            Apache Hadoop is an open source framework that is used to efficiently store and process large datasets ranging in size from gigabytes to petabytes of data. Instead of using one large computer to store and process the data, Hadoop allows clustering multiple computers to analyze massive datasets in parallel more quickly.
