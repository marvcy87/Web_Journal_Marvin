        <strong>History of Nanotechnolog</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                      <p>
                        Nanoparticles and structures have been used by humans in fourth century AD, by the Roman, which demonstrated one of the most interesting examples of nanotechnology in the ancient world. The Lycurgus cup, from the British Museum collection, represents one of the most outstanding achievements in ancient glass industry. It is the oldest famous example of dichroic glass. Dichroic glass describes two different types of glass, which change color in certain lighting conditions. This means that the Cup have two different colors: the glass appears green in direct light, and red-purple when light shines through the glass.

                                            Nanoscience involves the ability to see and to control individual molecules.

                                            Everything on Earth is made up of molecules, the food we eat, the medicines we take, the clothes we wear, the buildings and houses we live in, and our own bodies

                                          <p>
                                            Nanotechnology is based on molecular size. One nanometer is one billionth of a meter. Itʼs hard to imagine just how small that is, let’s take a look

        <strong>Applications of Nanotechnology</strong>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                        <ul>
                          <li><em>Electronics and IT Applications:</em> Transistors, the basic switches that enable all modern computing, have gotten smaller and smaller through nanotechnology. At the turn of the century, a typical transistor was 130 to 250 nanometers in size. In 2014, Intel created a 14 nanometer transistor, then IBM created the first seven nanometer transistor in 2015, and then Lawrence Berkeley National Lab demonstrated a one nanometer transistor in 2016!  Smaller, faster, and better transistors may mean that soon your computer’s entire memory may be stored on a single tiny chip.
                          </li>
                          <li><em>Medical and Healthcare Applications</em> Commercial applications have adapted gold nanoparticles as probes for the detection of targeted sequences of nucleic acids, and gold nanoparticles are also being clinically investigated as potential treatments for cancer and other diseases.
                          </li>
                          <li><em>Energy Applications</em> Nanotechnology is improving the efficiency of fuel production from raw petroleum materials through better catalysis. It is also enabling reduced fuel consumption in vehicles and power plants through higher-efficiency combustion and decreased friction.
                          </li>
                          <li><em>Environmental Remediation </em> Nanotechnology could help meet the need for affordable, clean drinking water through rapid, low-cost detection and treatment of impurities in water. 
                          </li>
                          <li><em>Future Transportation Benefits</em> Nanoscale sensors and devices may provide cost-effective continuous monitoring of the structural integrity and performance of bridges, tunnels, rails, parking structures, and pavements over time. Nanoscale sensors, communications devices, and other innovations enabled by nanoelectronics can also support an enhanced transportation infrastructure that can communicate with vehicle-based systems to help drivers maintain lane position, avoid collisions, adjust travel routes to avoid congestion, and improve drivers’ interfaces to onboard electronics.

        <strong>What is Biotechnology?</strong>

                        <p>
                          Biotechnology is technology that utilizes biological systems, living organisms or parts of this to develop or create different products.

                                <strong>Bioinformatics</strong> is an interdisciplinary field and one of the most popular domains within the field of biotechnology.

                                <strong>Diagnostics</strong> Diagnostics involve tests/procedures ordered by a physician and office visits needed to help diagnose or monitor a clinical condition or disease. Diagnostic care is basically a follow up of an issue from an irregular test result, an existing illness, injury or health problem already being treated by your doctor like diabetes, COPD, allergies, and more.

                                <strong>High throughput technologies </strong> are employed to study the genome (genomics), transcriptome (transcriptomics), proteome (proteomics), and metabolome (metabolomics). All these technologies together are referred to as multi-OMICS technology. Further, these different OMICS data are analyzed in an integrative fashion to bring out more biological meaning from the high-throughput data.

                            <p>
                                <strong>Plants </strong> are the major sources of food supply. They are also the major contributors of raw materials to industries. But many factors such as drought, land degradation, pests and diseases are coming in the way of production and productivity. Hence, new approaches are needed to expand production and improve food security.

                          <p>
                            Blockchain technology-is a structure that stores transactional records, also known as the block, of the public in several databases, known as the “chain,” in a network connected through peer-to-peer nodes. Typically, this storage is referred to as a 'digital ledger.'

                  <p>
                    - An electronic ledger is essentially a database containing all transactions that are constantly updated. It is composed of multiple blocks (each containing at least one transaction) and these blocks are linked together into a chain using cryptography. In other words, the following block will contain the cryptographic identifiers of the previous block. So, if any block in the past has a problem, it will affect all the blocks at the back of the chain.
